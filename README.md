# Road-to-DataScience-ML-Step1---DataCleaning-Tidying
In this project i will discuss the techniques involved in Data Preprocessing

Letâ€™s see what Data Preprocessing is about:
Before applying any Prediction Machine Learning Algorithm we need to do the preprocessing of data to improve the accuracy. In Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors applying our algorithms on it will result in Decrease of inaccuracy. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.
Data preprocessing is a Process Of Detecting And Correcting (Or Removing) Corrupt Or Inaccurate Records From A Record Set, Table, OR database And Refers To Identifying Incomplete, Incorrect, Inaccurate Or Irrelevant Parts Of The Data And Then Replacing, Modifying, Or Deleting The Dirty Or Coarse Data.

Softwares Needed: mostly i will be uploading my jupyter Notebooks and python codes, so its better to install:
1. Anaconda.
Pycharm.


Things I will discuss in this Repo: 

1.	Bbasiccmds.ipynb: Working on some Basic Commands that will be useful while dealing with datasets.
2.	Finding Missing values and Noisy data.
3.	Filling the missing values using some basic Techniques like: Mean, Median, Mode and some High level techniques like: k-Nearest Neighbors, Multivariate values(MICE), and Deep Learning.
4.	Trying to decrease or eradicate Noise in the data by applying Data tidying.
